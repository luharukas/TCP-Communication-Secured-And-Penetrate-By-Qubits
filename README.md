# TCP-IP-Client-Communication-Secured-And-Penetrate-By-Quantum-Computing.-

#### Introduction:
Quantum Computing, one of the trending and futuristic technology is common choices for the researchers. Many companies like Google, Microsoft, IBM D-Wave is showing their interest in these field. Quantum Computer can be used in different fields like in Machine Learning, Communication, Drug Development, Cybersecurity etc. In this project, I made an TCP/IP client communication system where message is sent to receiver encrypted using RSA Cryptography and on receive side it is penetrated by Quantum Computing Shor Algorithm. Peter Shor developed Shor algorithm. It is able to find the factors of number which is product to two prime number. 

#### Pseudo Code:
**Step 1:** - Make connection between server and client.
**Step 2:** - While making connection Quantum circuit find two prime number, and follow RSA cryptography algorithm to encrypt it.
**Step 3:** - If client receive a message, it is then decrypted by Shor algorithm.
**Step 4:** - Later messages will be displayed on the client screen
**Step 5:** - Appropriate message will be displayed if any client leave the server or interruption occur.
